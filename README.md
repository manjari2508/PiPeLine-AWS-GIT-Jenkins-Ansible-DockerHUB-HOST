# PiPLine-AWS-GIT-Jenkins-Ansible-DockerHUB-HOST

Our Pipeline involved the deployment of the job on the docker container through the developer.

.Developer adds the docker image on GITHUB

.GITHUB is integrated with jenkins which sends the file on the Ansible server.

.From the Ansible server the file is saved on our DOCKERHUB repository and finally deployed on the Docker Container.
